As part of my Statics coursework, I was tasked with designing a lifting mechanism within a constrained 2D space measuring 150 cm in length and 50 cm in height. The objective was to design a frame or mechanism capable of lifting the maximum possible weight to the highest elevation using: 
- a rigid bar of fixed length (self-selected)
- three pin supports, two of which were required to be ground mounted 
- a linear actuator selected from a commercial catalog 

This assignment deepened my understanding of how theoretical static principles applied in practical design.
